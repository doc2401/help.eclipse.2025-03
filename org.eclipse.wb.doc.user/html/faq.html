<h2 id="_what_should_i_do_if_im_getting_errors_using_the_update_manager">What should I do if I&#8217;m getting errors using the Update Manager?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you encounter some sort of Eclipse Update Manager failure with
messages such as "Downloaded stream not a valid archive" or "Problems
downloading artifact", this is caused by a common, well known flaw in
the Eclipse Update Manager with a very simple solution: wait five
minutes, restart Eclipse, and try it again. Re-starting Eclipse is
necessary as Eclipse will actually cache the failure and will refuse to
try again during the same session. If you try this a couple of times and
the problem persists, it could point to a more rare and troubling
problem with a corrupted Eclipse p2 plug-in cache. The next thing to try
in that case would be to re-install Eclipse and try again with a new,
clean Eclipse environment. If that does not help, send a screen shot of
your "Help &gt; About &gt; Installation Details &gt; Installed Software" page as
well as a copy of your complete "Help &gt; About &gt; Installation Details &gt;
Configuration" to support. You can also try installing into a new, clean
Eclipse environment using one of the ZIP install options on the product
download page.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="OtherGUIBuilders">Can WindowBuilder Pro edit windows created with JBuilder, VA Java, NetBeans, VisualCafe, etc.?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Most GUI builders in the world will only read and write the code
that they themselves create. WindowBuilder Pro is an exception to that
rule. It can read and edit not only the code it creates, but also a
great deal of code generated by other GUI builders (&gt;95%). We have had
very good success with code generated by JBuilder, NetBeans, Visual
Cafe, VA Java, the Eclipse VE, etc. If you come across a case that does
not work, send it to us for analysis. The more broken examples that we
can "fix", the better WindowBuilder Pro will get in the long run (and
the better chance you will have of salvaging your old code as-is). Note
that WindowBuilder Pro will edit any existing code in place without
changing its formatting. Any new widgets will be created using
WindowBuilder Pro&#8217;s own code generation preferences.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CreatedByHand">Can WindowBuilder Pro edit windows that have been created by hand?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Most GUI builders in the world will only read and write the code
that they themselves create. WindowBuilder Pro is an exception to that
rule. It can read and write not only the code it creates, but also a
great deal of code written by hand(&gt;90%). If you come across a case that
does not work, send it to us for analysis. The more broken examples that
we can "fix", the better WindowBuilder Pro will get in the long run (and
the better chance you will have of salvaging your old code as-is).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that dynamic GUI code can not be rendered or edited. The problem
with dynamic code is that it generally relies on runtime calculations
that have no meaning at runtime. Widgets created in a loop (where the
loop parameters are passed in externally) are a good example. Widgets
created in conditionals where the value of the conditional is not known
until runtime are another example. Dynamic GUI code constructed from the
results of complex database queries is yet another example.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="Refactor">Can I refactor or otherwise modify the WindowBuilder Pro generated code?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. The WindowBuilder Pro parser has a good understanding of basic Java
code and various Swing, SWT and other UI toolkit patterns patterns. As a
result, it is very refactoring friendly and very resilient in the face
of hand made changes. You can make changes or add code anywhere you like
and WindowBuilder Pro will reverse engineer it when possible. You can
also refactor the code in almost any conceivable way and WindowBuilder
Pro will still be able to parse it and render it in the design view. For
example, use the tool to create a new Swing JFrame, add some widgets,
and then use the Eclipse refactoring tools to extract some of the
widgets into their own methods.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="SpecialTags">Why doesn&#8217;t WindowBuilder Pro surround generate code with special tags or mark it as read-only?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using special tags or marking code read-only would go against several of
WindowBuilder Pro&#8217;s major design goals. WindowBuilder Pro does not make
any distinction between generated code and user-written code.
WindowBuilder Pro is designed to generated the same code that you would
write by hand and to make minimal changes to the source when you make a
change to the design view. WindowBuilder Pro never regenerates the
entire source for a file. If you change a single property, it will
change only a single line of code. That line of code could theoretically
be anywhere in the source file (including within lines originally
created by WindowBuilder Pro or within lines that you wrote by hand).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CantParse">Are there any specific constructs that WindowBuilder Pro can&#8217;t parse?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Here are some examples of constructs that WindowBuilder Pro does
not yet handle:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Re-use of GridBagConstraint objects across multiple widgets (we
support reusing the same variable but not the same objects)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI construction through the use of local parameterized helper methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple aliases (fields or local variables) referring to the same
component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple references to the same widget definition through multiple
invocations of the same helper method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic GUI code based on runtime calculations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="Constructor">Why does WindowBuilder Pro generate widgets in the constructor?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WindowBuilder Pro can generate code into any method that you like. One
of the key features of WindowBuilder Pro is its refactoring
friendliness. You can actually use any template that you want for
creating a new window (e.g., you don&#8217;t need to use the wizards supplied
with WindowBuilder Pro). Alternatively, you can use the Eclipse
refactoring commands to extract the components into a new method (like
createComponents()) and the tool will continue to work. Try the
following template for example:</p>

<h2 id="CustomWidgets">Can WindowBuilder Pro use custom widgets?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes., with a few restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Swing, any public JComponent subclass that has a public,
zero-argument constructor can be used (as required by the Java Bean
spec). Custom properties are derived through reflection by looking for
getter/setter pairs of known types. If a matching JavaBean class is
defined and available, it will be used for any custom properties. Custom
JPanel subclasses will show their subcomponents when placed in
WindowBuilder Pro. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For SWT, any public Control subclass that has a public, two-argument
constructor can be used (as is standard for all base SWT widgets).
Custom properties are derived through reflection by looking for
getter/setter pairs of known types. SWT does not yet define any kind of
JavaBean interface, so no further customization is available. Custom
Composite subclasses will show their subcomponents when placed in
WindowBuilder Pro.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For other UI toolkits, any public Widget subclass that has a public,
zero-argument constructor can be used. Custom properties are derived
through reflection by looking for getter/setter pairs of known types.
Custom Composite subclasses will show their subcomponents when placed in
WindowBuilder Pro. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: the Java Bean conventions (slightly modified for SWT) are
important from a GUI builder point of view as they establish a common,
expected, and, for the most part, self documenting API. If you create
your own unique constructors, your are, in effect, creating your own
personal API which makes it difficult for a GUI builder to reflectively
interact with your components. Generating code to a custom constructor
API requires knowledge of the API that generally is not provided by the
component. That requires hard coding knowledge of the component into the
GUI builder itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: A component may rely on some runtime behavior that is not possible
at design time (such as accessing an application database or some other
file). Runtime specific behavior should be isolated (and stubbed out as
necessary) by wrappering the runtime specific code with a call to
Beans.isDesignTime() which will answer true when the component is loaded
within WindowBuilder Pro and false at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="InstantiationException">What should I do if I encounter an InstantiationException or other error using a custom widget?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An InstantiationException means that WindowBuilder Pro could not create
an instance of a particular class. The most common reason for this is
that the component is not a <a href="#CustomWidgets">valid custom widget</a>. In
order to be a valid Swing widget, a class must be a valid Java Bean and
have a public, zero-argument constructor. SWT widgets must have a public
two-argument constructor with parent and style bits as the two
arguments. To fix the problem, add the missing constructor. Note: the
Java Bean conventions (slightly modified for SWT) are important from a
GUI builder point of view as they establish a common, expected, and, for
the most part, self documenting API. If you create your own unique
constructors, your are, in effect, creating your own personal API which
makes it difficult for a GUI builder to reflectively interact with your
components. Generating code to a custom constructor API requires
knowledge of the API that generally is not provided by the component.
That requires hard coding knowledge of the component into the GUI
builder itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another possible cause for this exception is some other failure in the
initialization code of the component. A component may rely on some
runtime behavior that is not possible at design time (such as accessing
an application database or some other file). Runtime specific behavior
should be isolated (and stubbed out as necessary) by wrappering the
runtime specific code with a call to <strong>Beans.isDesignTime()</strong> which will
answer true when the component is loaded within WindowBuilder Pro and
false at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="Installation">What should I do if WindowBuilder Pro does not appear after installation?</h2>

<p>First, make sure that the WindowBuilder Pro plugins have been installed
properly. If you used the ZIP installation, make sure that the
<strong>WindowBuilder Pro</strong> plugins were unzipped to your eclipse/plugins or

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are installing into Eclipse 3.4, there is a bug in the new p2
update manager that does not uninstall bundles (see bug
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=232094">232094</a>). To
workaround this  try deleting the bundles.info file from the
/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator directory and
restore the file from the Eclipse ZIP file. If deleting the bundles.info
was not sufficient, delete the entire /configuration and /p2 directories
from your eclipse directory and restore those directories from the
Eclipse ZIP file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After restarting Eclipse, open the Eclipse preference dialog and confirm
that you see a <a href="preferences/index.html">WindowBuilder preference
page</a>. If <strong>WindowBuilder Pro</strong> still does not appear, check your Eclipse
".log" file (found in your &lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory) for any
recorded exceptions and then contact support.If no exceptions are
present and <strong>WindowBuilder Pro</strong> is still not present, make sure that you
are using a properly configured Eclipse-based IDE. <strong>WindowBuilder Pro</strong>
requires the complete <strong>Eclipse SDK</strong> to be present, and will not load
into an Eclipse subset (like EasyEclipse or the MyEclipse All-in-one
edition). The most important piece missing from some Eclipse
distributions is the Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment). You
can correct this problem by launching Eclipse and selecting <strong>Help &gt;
Software Updates</strong>. Select The Eclipse Project updates from the list of
sites and select the "<strong>Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment</strong>" to
install. You may need to shutdown Eclipse and clean your configuration

<p>If WindowBuilder Pro fails to work properly (indicated by throwing a

following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Check that you have the correct version of WindowBuilder Pro installed
for your Eclipse environment. If you are using Eclipse 3.6, use the

at Eclipse 3.7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that only one version of WindowBuilder Pro (one set of
<strong>designer</strong> plugins and features) is installed. If you have an older
version also installed (indicated by an earlier version number), delete
those plugins and features and repeat step number two above. Make sure
that you don&#8217;t have WindowBuilder Pro installed both locally within your
Eclipse /plugins directory and remotely through a .link file (check your
Eclipse /links directory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your project for classpath problems and your code for
compilation problems. If your file or your project shows a red X,
WindowBuilder Pro may not be able to edit the file. Resolve the problem
and open the file again.</p>

<h2 id="NoClassDefFoundError">What should I do if I encounter an NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError using WindowBuilder Pro?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by checking your Eclipse ".log" file (found in your
<strong>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory</strong>). If the error references one of your
classes or methods, check that your classpath properly references the
class you are trying to use. Also check that your class is properly
compiled (no red <strong>X</strong>'s) and that a <strong>.class</strong> file exists in your projects
<strong>/bin</strong> directory. A mismatch between the JDK used to compile your code
and the JVM used to run Eclipse can also manifest itself as a
NoClassDefFoundError problem. For example, if you compile your code
using JDK 1.5 or 1.6 and then run your Eclipse using a 1.4 or 1.5 JVM,
you can have this problem. If the error refers to a custom widget, you
should also check that your component does not trigger an exception
during its initialization (which can manifest itself as a
NoClassDefFoundError). Try <strong>refreshing</strong> and <strong>cleaning</strong> your project
using the <strong>Project &gt; Clean&#8230;&#8203;</strong> or <strong>Project &gt; Build Project</strong> commands. If

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the error references a base Eclipse method or class, this means that
you have the wrong version of WindowBuilder Pro loaded for the version

the WindowBuilder Pro feature and plugin directories and then download
and install the correct version of  WindowBuilder Pro for the version of
Eclipse you are using.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the error refers to a method or class in a WindowBuilder Pro class,
this means that you have a serious Eclipse configuration problem, and
that one or more of the WindowBuilder Pro plugins are not being loaded
properly. If a plugin does not load, all of its methods will be
unreachable, and any attempts to access them will trigger a
NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError. This problem can usually be

<h2 id="LinuxFlashing">How can I prevent the preview window from flashing under Linux using Metacity</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to create the graphics that you see in the design view,
WindowBuilder Pro creates an off screen window containing the various
widgets and they takes a screen snapshot of them. This works very well
under Windows, OSX and some versions of Linux. Recent versions of the
Metacity window manager (more recent than 2.1.4), however, have been
modified/"fixed" to disallow windows to be opened off screen. This
forces the preview window to appear on screen leading to an annoying
flashing effect any time you make a change. The solution is to disable
the Metacity "fully_onscreen" constraint by patching the Metacity source
code and rebuilding and installing the patched version into your
system.<br>
<br>
Here are the steps to follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Download the Metacity source code from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/metacity/" class="bare">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/metacity/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpack the source code tarball into any temporary directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chdir into this directory (with the unpacked code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find window.c file and open it with your favourite texteditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a line with "window&#8594;require_fully_onscreen = TRUE;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace it with "window&#8594;require_fully_onscreen = FALSE;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the changes and close the editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal and chdir into the directory with the source code (nice if you have already done this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run "./configure".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run "make all".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that steps 9 &amp; 10 completed without errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become root (or execute the next command via "sudo" depending on the Linux you are running)</p>
