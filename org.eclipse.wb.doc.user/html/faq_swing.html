<h2 id="OtherGUIBuilders">Can Swing Designer edit windows created with JBuilder, VA Java, NetBeans, VisualCafe, etc.?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Most GUI builders in the world will only read and write the code
that they themselves create. Swing Designer is an exception to that
rule. It can read and edit not only the code it creates, but also a
great deal of code generated by other GUI builders (&gt;95%). We have had
very good success with code generated by JBuilder, NetBeans, Visual
Cafe, VA Java, the Eclipse VE, etc. If you come across a case that does
not work, send it to us for analysis. The more broken examples that we
can "fix", the better Swing Designer will get in the long run (and the
better chance you will have of salvaging your old code as-is). Note that
Swing Designer will edit any existing code in place without changing its
formatting. Any new widgets will be created using Swing Designer&#8217;s own
code generation preferences.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CreatedByHand">Can Swing Designer edit windows that have been created by hand?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Most GUI builders in the world will only read and write the code
that they themselves create. Swing Designer is an exception to that
rule. It can read and write not only the code it creates, but also a
great deal of code written by hand(&gt;90%). If you come across a case that
does not work, send it to us for analysis. The more broken examples that
we can "fix", the better Swing Designer will get in the long run (and
the better chance you will have of salvaging your old code as-is).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that dynamic GUI code can not be rendered or edited. The problem
with dynamic code is that it generally relies on runtime calculations
that have no meaning at runtime. Widgets created in a loop (where the
loop parameters are passed in externally) are a good example. Widgets
created in conditionals where the value of the conditional is not known
until runtime are another example. Dynamic GUI code constructed from the
results of complex database queries is yet another example.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="Refactor">Can I refactor or otherwise modify the Swing Designer generated code?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. The Swing Designer parser has a good understanding of basic Java
code and various Swing, SWT and other UI toolkit patterns. As a result,
it is very refactoring friendly and very resilient in the face of hand
made changes. You can make changes or add code anywhere you like and
Swing Designer will reverse engineer it when possible. You can also
refactor the code in almost any conceivable way and Swing Designer will
still be able to parse it and render it in the design view. For example,
use the tool to create a new Swing JFrame, add some widgets, and then
use the Eclipse refactoring tools to extract some of the widgets into
their own methods.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="SpecialTags">Why doesn&#8217;t Swing Designer surround generate code with special tags or mark it as read-only?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using special tags or marking code read-only would go against several of
Swing Designer&#8217;s major design goals. Swing Designer does not make any
distinction between generated code and user-written code. Swing Designer
is designed to generated the same code that you would write by hand and
to make minimal changes to the source when you make a change to the
design view. Swing Designer never regenerates the entire source for a
file. If you change a single property, it will change only a single line
of code. That line of code could theoretically be anywhere in the source
file (including within lines originally created by Swing Designer or
within lines that you wrote by hand).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CantParse">Are there any specific constructs that Swing Designer can&#8217;t parse?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. Here are some examples of constructs that Swing Designer does not
yet handle:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Re-use of GridBagConstraint objects across multiple widgets (we
support reusing the same variable but not the same objects)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI construction through the use of local parameterized helper methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple aliases (fields or local variables) referring to the same
component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple references to the same widget definition through multiple
invocations of the same helper method</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic GUI code based on runtime calculations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="CustomWidgets">Can Swing Designer use custom widgets?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes., with a few restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Swing, any public JComponent subclass that has a public,
zero-argument constructor can be used (as required by the Java Bean
spec). Custom properties are derived through reflection by looking for
getter/setter pairs of known types. If a matching JavaBean class is
defined and available, it will be used for any custom properties. Custom
JPanel subclasses will show their subcomponents when placed in Swing
Designer. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: the Java Bean conventions are important from a GUI builder point
of view as they establish a common, expected, and, for the most part,
self documenting API. If you create your own unique constructors, your
are, in effect, creating your own personal API which makes it difficult
for a GUI builder to reflectively interact with your components.
Generating code to a custom constructor API requires knowledge of the
API that generally is not provided by the component. That requires hard
coding knowledge of the component into the GUI builder itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: A component may rely on some runtime behavior that is not possible
at design time (such as accessing an application database or some other
file). Runtime specific behavior should be isolated (and stubbed out as
necessary) by wrappering the runtime specific code with a call to
Beans.isDesignTime() which will answer true when the component is loaded
within Swing Designer and false at runtime.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="DesignTab">What can I do if I don&#8217;t see the Design tab when I edit a window?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="features/images/open_with.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eclipse remembers the last editor type used with a file. If you don&#8217;t see the
<strong>Design</strong> tab, that means that you are using the standard Eclipse <strong>Java Editor</strong>
rather than the <a href="features/editing_existing_window.html"><strong>WindowBuilder</strong></a>
<strong><a href="features/editing_existing_window.html">Editor</a></strong>. Open the file with
the <a href="features/editing_existing_window.html"><strong>WindowBuilder</strong></a>
<strong><a href="features/editing_existing_window.html">Editor</a></strong> and you will see
both the <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>Design</strong> tabs. Note that Eclipse will only let you
have a file open with one editor at a time, so you may need to close any
existing editor before opening it with the
<a href="features/editing_existing_window.html"><strong>WindowBuilder</strong></a>
<strong><a href="features/editing_existing_window.html">Editor</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="features/images/source_design.png" alt="image" width="252" height="70"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="Exception">What should I do if I encounter an exception using Swing Designer?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a newer Swing Designer build is available than the one you are using,
please download the newer build and try and reproduce the problem. If
the problem has been reported in the past, there is a good chance that
it has already been fixed. If the problem still exists, you should send
your Eclipse ".log" file (found in your &lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory)
as well as any relevant test cases to support. Including a test case
that will help us reproduce the problem is very important. The faster we
can reproduce the problem, the faster we can get you a fix. If we can&#8217;t
reproduce a problem, there is little we can do to help you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, the test case you send should be the same window you were
editing when the problem occurred (along with any supporting files
needed to compile it). If that is not possible (possibly because you
aren&#8217;t allowed to send any code to a 3rd party), then you should try to
create a new, standalone test case that illustrates the same problem.
The best approach is to create a standalone test case by removing all of
the code that isn&#8217;t relevant to the problem at hand (e.g., keep deleting
code until the problem goes away and then restore that last code that
was last deleted).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="ParsingError">What should I do if I encounter "Unknown Window Type (Parsing Error)"?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As suggested by the message, this is error is caused by a parsing
problem. It has nothing to do with licensing. Your Eclipse ".log" file
(found in your &lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory) should provide a hint as
to the cause of the parsing error. Send the log file as well as a test
case to support (ideally the window you are trying to edit). Including a
test case that will help us reproduce the problem is very important. The
faster we can reproduce the problem, the faster we can get you a fix. If
we can&#8217;t reproduce a problem, there is little we can do to help you.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refreshing and rebuilding your project using the Project &gt; Clean command
can often help as can cleaning your Eclipse "configuration" directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="OutOfMemoryError">What should I do if I encounter an OutOfMemoryError using Swing Designer?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure that you have Eclipse configured to use enough memory. Begin
by specifying the starting amount of memory (-vmargs -Xms&#35;&#35;&#35;m)
in your Eclipse startup command line (e.g., the target field within a Windows
shortcut) or eclipse.ini file (in your Eclipse root directory). If this
is not specified, Eclipse&#8217;s starting amount of memory is quite small
(only 40 MB). You should also specify the maximum amount of memory that
Eclipse can use (-vmargs -Xmx&#35;&#35;&#35;m) and the maximum amount of
perm space available (-vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=&#35;&#35;&#35;m).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We typically recommend something like this (these setting are
independent of any of the startup settings that you might have in
place):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>-vmargs -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xms256m -Xmx512m</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An OutOfMemoryError is usually a side effect of something else, so you
should send your Eclipse ".log" file (found in your
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory) as well as any relevant test cases to
support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might try running Eclipse with the -debug command line option. You
can then press Ctrl+Break in the console to look at the thread dump
which may show where the system is locking up and where the memory is
going. Send that thread dump to support.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="NoClassDefFoundError">What should I do if I encounter an NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError using Swing Designer?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by checking your Eclipse ".log" file (found in your
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory). If the error references one of your
classes or methods, check that your classpath properly references the
class you are trying to use. Also check that your class is properly
compiled (no red <strong>X</strong>'s) and that a <strong>.class</strong> file exists in your projects
<strong>/bin</strong> directory. A mismatch between the JDK used to compile your code
and the JVM used to run Eclipse can also manifest itself as a
NoClassDefFoundError problem. For example, if you compile your code
using JDK 1.5 or 1.6 and then run your Eclipse using a 1.4 or 1.5 JVM,
you can have this problem. If the error refers to a custom widget, you
should also check that your component does not trigger an exception
during its initialization (which can manifest itself as a
NoClassDefFoundError). Try <strong>refreshing</strong> and <strong>cleaning</strong> your project
using the <strong>Project &gt; Clean&#8230;&#8203;</strong> or <strong>Project &gt; Build Project</strong> commands. If
that does not help, send a test case to support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the error references a base Eclipse method or class, this means that
you have the wrong version of Swing Designer loaded for the version of
Eclipse you are using. Swing Designer is trying to access a method or
class that simply does not exist in your Eclipse distribution. Delete
the Swing Designer feature and plugin directories and then download and
install the correct version of  Swing Designer for the version of
Eclipse you are using.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="UnsupportedClassVersionError">What should I do if I encounter an UnsupportedClassVersionError using Swing Designer?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An UnsupportedClassVersionError is usually caused by attempting to run
code compiled against a later JRE with an IDE using an earlier JRE.
Typically, you will see this when trying to use a class (such as a
custom widget) that has been compiled against JDK 1.6 within a version
of Eclipse launched with JDK 1.5.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two solutions are possible: you may either recompile the class using JDK
1.5, or you can tell Eclipse to run using JDK 1.6 by modifying its
startup parameters as follows (use your path to JDK 1.6 on your system):</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>-vm C:\jdk1.6.0_21\bin\java.exe</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="UnsatisfiedLinkError">What should I do if I encounter an UnsatisfiedLinkError when launching my SWT application?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated in the product docs and tutorial, the Eclipse SWT DLL (which
can be found in the
$ECLIPSE$\plugins\org.eclipse.swt.win32_x.x.x\os\win32\x86\ directory or
in the org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.x.x.jar file) needs to be on
your path. Placing it into your windows/system32 directory is the
easiest thing to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Linux, you need to locate the corresponding Eclipse SWT *.so files
contained in the SWT GTK plugin.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="InstantiationException">What should I do if I encounter an InstantiationException or other error using a custom widget?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An InstantiationException means that Swing Designer could not create an
instance of a particular class. The most common reason for this is that
the component is not a <a href="#CustomWidgets">valid custom widget</a>. In
order to be a valid Swing widget, a class must be a valid Java Bean and
have a public, zero-argument constructor. SWT widgets must have a public
two-argument constructor with parent and style bits as the two
arguments. To fix the problem, add the missing constructor. Note: the
Java Bean conventions (slightly modified for SWT) are important from a
GUI builder point of view as they establish a common, expected, and, for
the most part, self documenting API. If you create your own unique
constructors, your are, in effect, creating your own personal API which
makes it difficult for a GUI builder to reflectively interact with your
components. Generating code to a custom constructor API requires
knowledge of the API that generally is not provided by the component.
That requires hard coding knowledge of the component into the GUI
builder itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another possible cause for this exception is some other failure in the
initialization code of the component. A component may rely on some
runtime behavior that is not possible at design time (such as accessing
an application database or some other file). Runtime specific behavior
should be isolated (and stubbed out as necessary) by wrappering the
runtime specific code with a call to Beans.isDesignTime() which will
answer true when the component is loaded within Swing Designer and false
at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="Linux">How should Swing Designer be configured to work on Linux?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use Swing Designer in Linux, we recommend that you use an official
JDK from Sun, as using the GPL version of the java is not recommended.
Here are some setup instructions for using Sun&#8217;s java with Fedora Core
and Debian. Note that use of a non-Sun JDK can result in Eclipse locking
up.<br>
<br>
Using Sun&#8217;s Java with Fedora Core:</p>

<h2 id="LinuxFlashing">How can I prevent the preview window from flashing under Linux using Metacity</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to create the graphics that you see in the design view, Swing
Designer creates an off screen window containing the various widgets and
they takes a screen snapshot of them. This works very well under
Windows, OSX and some versions of Linux. Recent versions of the Metacity
window manager (more recent than 2.1.4), however, have been
modified/"fixed" to disallow windows to be opened off screen. This
forces the preview window to appear on screen leading to an annoying
flashing effect any time you make a change. The solution is to disable
the Metacity "fully_onscreen" constraint by patching the Metacity source
code and rebuilding and installing the patched version into your
system.<br>
<br>
Here are the steps to follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Download the Metacity source code from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/metacity/" class="bare">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/metacity/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpack the source code tarball into any temporary directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chdir into this directory (with the unpacked code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find window.c file and open it with your favourite texteditor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a line with "window&#8594;require_fully_onscreen = TRUE;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace it with "window&#8594;require_fully_onscreen = FALSE;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the changes and close the editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a terminal and chdir into the directory with the source code (nice if you have already done this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run "./configure".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run "make all".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that steps 9 &amp; 10 completed without errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become root (or execute the next command via "sudo" depending on the Linux you are running)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run "make install" (or "sudo make install").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save your work and close any application you are working with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End your session (or press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to restart the x-server) and log in again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are done!</p>
</li>
