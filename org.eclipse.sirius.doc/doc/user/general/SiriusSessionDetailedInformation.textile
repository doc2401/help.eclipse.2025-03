h1. Sirius Session detailed information

This document describes how to see information on the opened Sirius Session.

The Sirius Session is the runtime concept of a Sirius Modeling Project. It corresponds mainly to the information in memory of an opened Sirius project.

To get this information, right click on the aird and select *Properties* and then *Sirius Session Details*.

The Sirius Session detailed information tab provides information about
* the resources used (aird, srm, semantic and controlled resources as well) with number of contained elements
* the viewpoints used
* the representations (number, size, loaded representations, invalid representations, etc)

It also provides project dependencies information:
* General project dependencies: All direct and indirect projects that are used by the current project. They are projects that contain an aird or a semantic resource used by the current project. To calculate the indirect projects, it checks dependencies from the aird of the direct project dependency and so on recursively.
* Images project dependencies: Projects that contain images used by the nodes of the diagrams or by the rich text description.
